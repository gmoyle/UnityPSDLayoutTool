How to Use
==========
The PSD Layout Tool is implemented as a Unity Custom Inspector.  If you select a PSD file that you have in your project (Assets folder) special buttons will appear above the default importer settings.

![](screenshots/inspector.png?raw=true)

* **Maximum Depth**
  * The maximum depth value (Z position) to use when laying the layers out.  The front-most layer (minimum depth) is always 0.
* **Pixels to Unity Units**
  * The scale to use when generating Unity Sprites, in pixels to Unity world units (meters).
* **Use Unity UI**
  * Check to generate Unity 4.6+ UI elements instead of "normal" GameObjects.
* **Export Layers as Textures**
  * Creates a .png image file for each layer in the PSD file, using the same folder structure.
* **Layout in Current Scene**
  * Creates a Unity 4.3+ Sprite object for each layer in the PSD file.  It is laid out to match the PSD's layout and folder structure.
* **Generate Prefab**
  * Identical to the previous option, but it generates a .prefab file instead of putting the objects in the scene.

Special Tags
==========
Layers can have special tags applied to them that flags them to have the layout tool perform special operations on them.

### Group Layer Tags ###

|        Tag        | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
|  &#124;Animation  |  Creates a Sprite animation using all of the children layers as frames |
|  &#124;FPS=##     |  The number of frames per second to use for a Sprite animation.  Defaults to 30 if not present  | 
|  &#124;Button     |  Creates a Button object using any tagged children layers as the button states |

### Art Layer Tags ###

|        Tag          | Description |
| -----------------   | ----------- |
|  &#124;Disabled     |  Represents the disabled state of a button     |
|  &#124;Highlighted  |  Represents the highlighted state of a button  | 
|  &#124;Pressed      |  Represents the pressed state of a button  | 
|  &#124;Default      |  Represents the default/enabled/normal/up state of a button  | 
|  &#124;Enabled      |  Represents the default/enabled/normal/up state of a button  |
|  &#124;Normal       |  Represents the default/enabled/normal/up state of a button  |
|  &#124;Up           |  Represents the default/enabled/normal/up state of a button  |
|  &#124;Text         |  Represents a **texture** that is the text of a button (normal text layers import without this tag)  |

## TextMeshPro Integration

The Unity PSD Layout Tool now provides **full TextMeshPro integration** for superior text rendering quality and performance:

### Automatic Font Import
- **System Font Detection**: Automatically scans Windows, macOS, and Linux system font directories
- **Font Matching**: Matches PSD text layer fonts with system-installed TTF/OTF fonts by name
- **Automatic Import**: Imports matched fonts into Unity's Assets folder if not already present
- **TMP Asset Creation**: Automatically creates TextMeshPro font assets using Unity's TextMeshPro API
- **Font Caching**: Caches font files and TMP assets for improved performance on subsequent imports

### Text Component Creation
- **3D Text**: Creates `TextMeshPro` components for sprite-based layouts
- **UI Text**: Creates `TextMeshProUGUI` components for Unity UI layouts
- **Property Preservation**: Maintains text content, font size, color, and alignment from PSD layers
- **Fallback Support**: Uses default TMP fonts when system fonts cannot be found or imported

### Supported Font Properties
- **Font Family**: Matches font family names from PSD text layers
- **Font Size**: Preserves original font size from Photoshop
- **Text Color**: Maintains text fill color from PSD layers
- **Text Alignment**: Supports Left, Center, and Right text justification
- **Multi-line Text**: Handles multi-line text content properly

### Font Management
- **Preloading**: System fonts are preloaded during PSD import for faster processing
- **Cache Management**: Built-in cache clearing and font reloading capabilities
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to default fonts when font import fails
- **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux development environments

### Usage Notes
- **Automatic Operation**: Font matching and import happens automatically during PSD import
- **No Configuration**: No manual setup required - fonts are detected and imported transparently
- **Performance**: First import may take longer due to font asset creation, subsequent imports are faster
- **Font Requirements**: System fonts must be installed and accessible to be imported

## Photoshop Compatibility

Smart Objects are supported, and do not need to be flattened/rasterized in Photoshop before importing.

## Blend Mode Support

The Unity PSD Layout Tool provides **complete Photoshop blend mode compatibility** with mathematically accurate shader implementations. All 16 standard Photoshop blend modes are supported and automatically applied during import.

## Supported Blend Modes

### Basic Blend Modes
| Blend Mode | Photoshop Key | Description | Implementation |
|------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Normal** | `norm` | Standard alpha blending | Unity default material |
| **Multiply** | `mult` | Darkens by multiplying colors | Custom multiply shader |
| **Screen** | `scrn` | Lightens by inverting, multiplying, and inverting again | Custom screen shader |
| **Overlay** | `over` | Combines multiply and screen based on base color | Custom overlay shader |

### Light Blend Modes
| Blend Mode | Photoshop Key | Description | Implementation |
|------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Soft Light** | `sLit` | Softer version of overlay | Custom soft light shader |
| **Hard Light** | `hLit` | Combines multiply and screen based on blend color | Custom hard light shader |
| **Color Dodge** | `cDdg` | Brightens base color by decreasing contrast | Custom color dodge shader |
| **Color Burn** | `cBrn` | Darkens base color by increasing contrast | Custom color burn shader |

### Comparative Blend Modes
| Blend Mode | Photoshop Key | Description | Implementation |
|------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Darken** | `dark` | Selects the darker of base and blend colors | Custom darken shader |
| **Lighten** | `lite` | Selects the lighter of base and blend colors | Custom lighten shader |
| **Difference** | `diff` | Subtracts darker color from lighter color | Custom difference shader |
| **Exclusion** | `smud` | Similar to difference but with lower contrast | Custom exclusion shader |

### HSV-Based Blend Modes
| Blend Mode | Photoshop Key | Description | Implementation |
|------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Hue** | `hue ` | Uses hue from blend, saturation/value from base | HSV color space conversion shader |
| **Saturation** | `sat ` | Uses saturation from blend, hue/value from base | HSV color space conversion shader |
| **Color** | `colr` | Uses hue/saturation from blend, value from base | HSV color space conversion shader |
| **Luminosity** | `lum ` | Uses value from blend, hue/saturation from base | HSV color space conversion shader |

## Technical Implementation

### Sprite Renderers
For sprite-based layouts, blend modes are applied by:
1. **Automatic Detection**: The tool reads the blend mode key from each PSD layer
2. **Material Creation**: Custom materials are created using the appropriate blend mode shader
3. **Shader Assignment**: The material is automatically assigned to the sprite renderer

### UI Elements
For Unity UI layouts, blend modes are handled with:
- **Limited Support**: Basic blend modes (Multiply, Screen, Overlay, Soft Light, Hard Light) work with UI materials
- **Fallback Behavior**: Advanced blend modes fall back to normal rendering for UI elements due to UI rendering pipeline limitations

### Shader Quality
- **Mathematical Accuracy**: All shaders implement the exact mathematical formulas used by Photoshop
- **Color Space Conversion**: HSV-based blend modes include proper RGB↔HSV conversion functions
- **Performance Optimized**: Shaders are optimized for real-time rendering while maintaining accuracy
- **Unity Compatible**: All shaders follow Unity's sprite shader conventions and support standard features

## Usage Notes

### Automatic Application
Blend modes are automatically applied during import - no manual configuration required:
```
1. Import your PSD file into Unity
2. Select the PSD file in the Project window
3. Use "Layout in Current Scene" or "Generate Prefab" 
4. Blend modes are automatically detected and applied
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Shader Compilation**: First use of each blend mode may cause a brief shader compilation
- **Draw Calls**: Each unique blend mode creates a separate draw call
- **Mobile Performance**: Complex blend modes (HSV-based) may impact performance on low-end mobile devices

### Troubleshooting
- **Missing Shaders**: If blend mode shaders are missing, the tool falls back to Unity's default sprite material
- **Warning Messages**: Check the Console for any blend mode application warnings
- **Unexpected Results**: Ensure your PSD layers use standard Photoshop blend modes (custom blend modes are not supported)
